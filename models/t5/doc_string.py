T5_START_DOCSTRING = r"""

    The T5 model was proposed in [Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text
    Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683) by Colin Raffel, Noam Shazeer, Adam Roberts, Katherine Lee, Sharan
    Narang, Michael Matena, Yanqi Zhou, Wei Li, Peter J. Liu. It's an encoder decoder transformer pre-trained in a
    text-to-text denoising generative setting.

    This model inherits from [`PreTrainedModel`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
    library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
    etc.)

    This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
    Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
    and behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`T5Config`]): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
            Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
            configuration. Check out the [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.

T5_INPUTS_DOCSTRING = r"""
    Args:
        input_ids (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`):
            Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary. T5 is a model with relative position embeddings so you
            should be able to pad the inputs on both the right and the left.

            Indices can be obtained using [`AutoTokenizer`]. See [`PreTrainedTokenizer.encode`] and
            [`PreTrainedTokenizer.__call__`] for detail.

            [What are input IDs?](../glossary#input-ids)

            To know more on how to prepare `input_ids` for pretraining take a look a [T5 Training](./t5#training).
        attention_mask (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*):
            Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

            - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
            - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

            [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)
        decoder_input_ids (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, *optional*):
            Indices of decoder input sequence tokens in the vocabulary.

            Indices can be obtained using [`AutoTokenizer`]. See [`PreTrainedTokenizer.encode`] and
            [`PreTrainedTokenizer.__call__`] for details.

            [What are decoder input IDs?](../glossary#decoder-input-ids)

            T5 uses the `pad_token_id` as the starting token for `decoder_input_ids` generation. If `past_key_values`
            is used, optionally only the last `decoder_input_ids` have to be input (see `past_key_values`).

            To know more on how to prepare `decoder_input_ids` for pretraining take a look at [T5
            Training](./t5#training).
        decoder_attention_mask (`torch.BoolTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, *optional*):
            Default behavior: generate a tensor that ignores pad tokens in `decoder_input_ids`. Causal mask will also
            be used by default.
        head_mask (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(num_heads,)` or `(num_layers, num_heads)`, *optional*):
            Mask to nullify selected heads of the self-attention modules in the encoder. Mask values selected in `[0,
            1]`:

            - 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
            - 0 indicates the head is **masked**.

        decoder_head_mask (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(num_heads,)` or `(num_layers, num_heads)`, *optional*):
            Mask to nullify selected heads of the self-attention modules in the decoder. Mask values selected in `[0,
            1]`:

            - 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
            - 0 indicates the head is **masked**.

        cross_attn_head_mask (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(num_heads,)` or `(num_layers, num_heads)`, *optional*):
                Mask to nullify selected heads of the cross-attention modules in the decoder. Mask values selected in
                `[0, 1]`:

                - 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
                - 0 indicates the head is **masked**.

        encoder_outputs (`tuple(tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*):
            Tuple consists of (`last_hidden_state`, `optional`: *hidden_states*, `optional`: *attentions*)
            `last_hidden_state` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)` is a sequence of hidden states at
            the output of the last layer of the encoder. Used in the cross-attention of the decoder.
        past_key_values (`tuple(tuple(torch.FloatTensor))` of length `config.n_layers` with each tuple having 4 tensors of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length - 1, embed_size_per_head)`):
            Contains precomputed key and value hidden states of the attention blocks. Can be used to speed up decoding.

            If `past_key_values` are used, the user can optionally input only the last `decoder_input_ids` (those that
            don't have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, 1)` instead of all
            `decoder_input_ids` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
        inputs_embeds (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*):
            Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This
            is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the
            model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
        decoder_inputs_embeds (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*):
            Optionally, instead of passing `decoder_input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded
            representation. If `past_key_values` is used, optionally only the last `decoder_inputs_embeds` have to be
            input (see `past_key_values`). This is useful if you want more control over how to convert
            `decoder_input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the model's internal embedding lookup matrix.

            If `decoder_input_ids` and `decoder_inputs_embeds` are both unset, `decoder_inputs_embeds` takes the value
            of `inputs_embeds`.

        use_cache (`bool`, *optional*):
            If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up decoding (see
            `past_key_values`).

        output_attentions (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned
            tensors for more detail.
        output_hidden_states (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See `hidden_states` under returned tensors for
            more detail.
        return_dict (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether or not to return a [`~utils.ModelOutput`] instead of a plain tuple.

PARALLELIZE_DOCSTRING = r"""
    This is an experimental feature and is a subject to change at a moment's notice.

    Uses a device map to distribute attention modules of the model across several devices. If no device map is given,
    it will evenly distribute blocks across all devices.

    Args:
        device_map (`Dict[int, list]`, optional, defaults to None):
            A dictionary that maps attention modules to devices. Note that the embedding module and LMHead are always
            automatically mapped to the first device (for esoteric reasons). That means that the first device should
            have fewer attention modules mapped to it than other devices. For reference, the t5 models have the
            following number of attention modules:

                - t5-small: 6
                - t5-base: 12
                - t5-large: 24
                - t5-3b: 24
                - t5-11b: 24

    Example:

    ```python
    # Here is an example of a device map on a machine with 4 GPUs using t5-3b, which has a total of 24 attention modules:
    model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("t5-3b")

        3: [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23],
